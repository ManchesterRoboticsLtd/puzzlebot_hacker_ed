## Introduction
* **The Hackerboard** is the core electronics platform designed by Manchester Robotics to power the Puzzlebot family of educational robots. It offers a compact, modular, and robust hardware interface for real-time control, sensor integration, and communication with embedded Linux systems like the Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi.

* Puzzlebot in all its version, is powered by the **Hackerboard** for algorithms which require real-time processing capabilities, such as: Low level control, Navigation, Obstacle avoidance, 2D-LiDAR based SLAM, Fault tolerant control.
